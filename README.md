# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Implementation-on-Economics-index-data-set

This project presents the implementation of a multiple linear regression model on a dataset comprising economic indices. The goal is to predict index prices using multiple independent variables.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains observations on various economic indices and their corresponding index prices. It includes information on factors such as interest rates (x1) and inflation rates (x2). There are a total of 18 observations in the dataset.

Model Performance

R-squared (uncentered): 0.035

Indicates that approximately 3.5% of the variance in the index prices is explained by the independent variables in the model.

Adjusted R-squared (uncentered): -0.086

The adjusted R-squared value suggests that the model may not be adequately capturing the relationships within the data.

F-statistic: 0.2880

The F-statistic and its associated p-value indicate that the model is not statistically significant.

Coefficients:

x1: 88.2728, p-value: 0.895

x2: -116.2572, p-value: 0.862

Both coefficients are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
